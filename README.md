## Steps to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Cloudinary account (for resume uploads)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd Candidate-Referral-Management-System
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```sh
cd server
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory (already present in your codebase):

  ```
  PORT=1305
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/candidate_referral_management_system
  JWT_TOKEN=your_jwt_secret
  CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
  API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
  API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
  ```

- Start the backend server:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```sh
cd ../client
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory (already present):

  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:1305
  ```

- Start the frontend development server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

- Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---
### 3. Setup Cloudinary

- after creating new account on Cloudinary by default, free/new accounts are blocked from directly delivering PDF files, resulting in an "untrusted" error when trying to view them inline
- Log into Cloudinary Console

- Go to Settings â†’ Security

- Locate "PDF and ZIP files delivery" section

- Enable the option (toggle on)

- Save your changes and accept any prompts

## Assumptions & Limitations

- **User Roles:** Only "user" and "admin" roles are supported, but admin features are not implemented yet.
- **No Email Verification:** Registration does not send verification emails.
- **No Password Reset:** There is no password reset functionality.
- **No Pagination:** Candidate dashboard does not paginate results.
- **No Rate Limiting:** APIs are not rate-limited.
- **Cloudinary Credentials:** You must provide your own Cloudinary credentials in the backend `.env` file.
